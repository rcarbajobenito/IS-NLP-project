<h1 align="center"> Natural Language Processing for Drug Reviews Classification </h1>
Natural Language Processing project for the Intelligent Systems course using R.

## Description
In this project, the reviews of different drugs will be analysed to then be classified into the categories bad, neutral, and good based on the rating that the users of the drug gave them. Knowing which drugs are more accepted or useful for the consumers can be very useful for pharmaceutical companies, not only to define the drugs produced by the company with the best and worst acceptance in the market, but also to do so with the products of other competitor companies.

The dataset is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Drugs.com%29

## Running the code
The code is provided both as a R and a RMD files. To replicate the results simply run one of those scripts, making sure the data is in the same folder.
